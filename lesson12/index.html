        <meta name="description" content="The Temple Inn & Suites is a hotel chain headquartered in Bethesda, MD that builds 
        and manages specialized hotel accommodations near temple locations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
        around the world. The owner-operated company caters to temple workers, patrons, and their families by providing 
        specialized services and accommodations that meet the needs of those patrons. The hotel accommodations and services 
        are available to anyone willing to abide by the terms and policies outlined by the company. The overall goal of the 
        website project is to promote and provide information about the specialized services that this hotel chain offers to 
        meet the needs of temple patrons who come to serve in the temple or who participate in events such as sealings, 
        weddings, receptions, and youth trips. The website should reflect the Church culture and be designed to support a 
        temple oriented theme as well as the concept of being a haven of comfort and accessibility.">

                        <h2>Temple Attending Activities</h2>
                        <h3>Baptism</h3>
                        <p>In temples, faithful Church members are baptized for these people—a practice that also occurred in biblical 
                            times. Participants dress in white and are baptized by immersion on behalf of family members who have 
                            died without being baptized into His Church. Baptisms for the dead give the deceased the opportunity to 
                            choose whether or not to accept this baptism and to accept to follow Jesus Christ.</p> 
                        <h3>Endowment</h3>
                        <p>
                            The endowment ceremony teaches about God's love for all His children and His plan for their happiness. 
                            Participants make special promises to God, called covenants. They covenant to obey God's commandments and 
                            follow Jesus Christ. In return, God promises wonderful blessings in this life and the opportunity to live 
                            with Him as eternal families after this life.</p>
                        <h3>Sealment</h3>
                        <p>Wedding ceremonies called sealings also take place inside temples. God wants us to be happily ever after, 
                            so marriage and family relationships should last far beyond “till death do us part.”

                            During the sealing in the temple, the bride and groom kneel and join hands at a simple altar. They 
                            promise to honor and love one another, and they pledge to follow Jesus Christ. In return, they are 
                            promised the sealing blessings of receiving all that the Father has, including marriage and family 
                            forever, even after death.</p>

                        <h2> - Mr. Thompson</h2>
                        <p>It really was an amazing week. I loved the hotel accommodations and the peace I had not only in the temple 
                            but also in the hotel. The room I stayed in was very clean, the bed was comfortable and the breakfast 
                            was amazing.</p>
                        <h2>Smith Family</h2>
                        <p>The whole family loved the hotel. We stayed in an amazing room that accommodated the whole family, we didn't 
                            have to sleep apart and there were even features available for babies. The free transfer from the hotel 
                            to the temple helped us a lot.</p>
                        <h2>Bonnie and Toddy</h2>
                        <p>My fiance and I decided to stay at the hotel due to the excellent reviews and I can now say for myself that 
                            the hotel is indeed of excellent quality. The hotel brought us a feeling of peace and joy as if we were 
                            already in the temple. And I can't forget to mention that as soon as we arrived at the hotel, we had a 
                            special reception made for newlyweds.</p>
                        <h2>Miss Rockfield</h2>
                        <p>I was baptized last year and I always heard about temples. When the time finally came to visit the House 
                            of the Lord, I decided to stay where everyone told me would be the best place, and it really was. 
                            The breakfast was amazing, I was able to watch General Conference talks on TV, my transfer to the temple 
                            was free and I was able to find more ancestors names at the hotel itself.</p>
