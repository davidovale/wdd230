        <meta name="description" content="The Temple Inn & Suites is a hotel chain headquartered in Bethesda, MD that builds 
        and manages specialized hotel accommodations near temple locations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
        around the world. The owner-operated company caters to temple workers, patrons, and their families by providing 
        specialized services and accommodations that meet the needs of those patrons. The hotel accommodations and services 
        are available to anyone willing to abide by the terms and policies outlined by the company. The overall goal of the 
        website project is to promote and provide information about the specialized services that this hotel chain offers to 
        meet the needs of temple patrons who come to serve in the temple or who participate in events such as sealings, 
        weddings, receptions, and youth trips. The website should reflect the Church culture and be designed to support a 
        temple oriented theme as well as the concept of being a haven of comfort and accessibility.">
