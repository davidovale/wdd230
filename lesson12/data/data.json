Bednar, where the current Temple design was revealed to the members present and, consequently, to the general public. On the occasion, before the congregation, the apostle of the Church spoke in his speech: “This temple will be a source of hope, of light and of faith in God for all those who come here and walk on this ground. This city will always be better and different, due to the Temple that will be built here. On behalf of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I express gratitude.",
